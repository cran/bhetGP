Description: Performs Bayesian posterior inference for heteroskedastic Gaussian processes.
    Models are trained through MCMC including elliptical slice sampling (ESS) of 
    latent noise processes and Metropolis-Hastings sampling of 
    kernel hyperparameters. Replicates are handled efficientyly through a
    Woodbury formulation of the joint likelihood for the mean and noise process 
    (Binois, M., Gramacy, R., Ludkovski, M. (2018) <doi:10.1080/10618600.2018.1458625>)
    For large data, Vecchia-approximation for faster 
    computation is leveraged (Sauer, A., Cooper, A., and Gramacy, R.,
    (2023), <doi:10.1080/10618600.2022.2129662>). Incorporates 'OpenMP' and 
    SNOW parallelization and utilizes 'C'/'C++' under the hood.
